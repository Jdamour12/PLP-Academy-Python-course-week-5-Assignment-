# PLP-Academy-Python-course-week-5-Assignment

File Creation:

- Created a Python script (file_handling_assignment.py) that does the following:
- Created a new text file named "my_file.txt" in write mode ('w').
- Wrote at least three lines of text to the file, including a mix of strings and numbers.

File Reading and Display:

- Enhanced my script to read the contents of "my_file.txt" and display them on the console.

File Appending:

- Modified the script to open "my_file.txt" in append mode ('a').
- Appended three additional lines of text to the existing content.

Error Handling:

- Implemented error handling using try, except, and finally blocks to manage potential file-related exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError, PermissionError).
